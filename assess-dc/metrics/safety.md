title: Safety
description: Democratic capitalism has good principles around safety.
---

DC is pretty good in terms of safety as the government regulates industry with safety requirements. Although, sometimes this can be an issue as:

* The government is always playing catch up as new laws are required due to changing technologies.
* Making goods and services safe costs money which works against a companies' core goal of making money. This can lead to corners being cut to increase profit at the cost of safety.
