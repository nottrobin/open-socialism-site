title: 'Safety'

DC is pretty good in terms of safety in that the government sets laws that should ensure that companies produce safe goods and services. Although, sometimes this can be an issue as:

* The government is always playing catch up as new laws are required due to changing technologies.
* Making goods and services safe costs money which is the works against a companies core goal of making money. This leads to corners sometimes being cut as the rules are bent or broken.
