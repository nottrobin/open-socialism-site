DC is quite poor in terms of happiness.

## Low Level Of Integration With Local Communities

In DC local communities do not integrate well. People are generally respectful to their neighbors that live very close to them but usually that is as far as it goes. Humans are tribal and are happier when living in communities that they are integrated with, but nothing in DC promotes this.

## Work Is Unsatisfying

In DC the majority of people do not work for the greater good and additionally their work doesn't improve their own lives. Rather they work for a corporation that they have no care for beyond the salary they receive. Great work by them only makes the corporation wealthier but does little good beyond that. This is inherently unsatisfying since we are programmed to want to work towards a better future for ourselves and our communities but most people can't do this in DC. Options that are like this such as working for the government conflict with our desire to be selfish and benefit ourselves as such jobs are generally lower pay and prestige.

The other option is starting a business which can be a jackpot in terms of money in rare cases. Even so this work still often isn't particularly doing great things for the community.  [The reason for this is that poor, unemployed, the homeless, the neediest of our societies don't have a lot of money to spend on the services that new entrepreneurs create](http://miter.mit.edu/the-unexotic-underclass){:target="_blank"}. Making rich people richer or making middle classes people's lives slightly more convenient isn't a bad thing but it won't provide deep satisfaction to most people.

## Poor Distribute Of Wealth Creates A Variety Of Problems

[The non-wealthy are less happy when there is a large amount of wealth inequality](http://www.livescience.com/14638-income-inequality-costing-americans-happiness.html){:target="_blank"}. When you elevate certain people with extreme wealth, especially when the poor are struggling it promotes unhappiness.

## The Result

We have evolved to be happy by excelling whilst helping our community and by extension ourselves. DC is a very different model and unsatisfyingly selfish without much sense of a community around us. This all promotes unhappiness.
