title: 'Rights Equality'
---

DC has, at a legal level, quite a fair system where on paper everyone has the same rights. Let's look at how this works for some different areas.

##  Schooling

All people are entitled to go to public schools. Unfortunately public schools may or may not be very good. Those with money can afford to go to private schools that are usually better. Everyone has the right to go to a private school if they have the money. Since not everyone has the money this is not the same level of rights.

## Health

Depending on the country there is a varying level of free public health. However, all countries have an elite level of care that requires money.

## Legal

Legal matters require money in most cases and unfortunately having more money available gives a person a large advantage in legal matters.

## The Result

Rights equality is not achieved by DC, however a basic level of rights has been achieved.
