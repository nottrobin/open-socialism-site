DC has some issues in terms of health. Companies are not concerned with the health of their customers, just with how well they can sell to them. This often involves deceiving the customer about the healthiness of certain products. For example a product that has lots of added sugar but has packaging suggesting it is healthy.

People are taught good principles of being healthy such as a eating a balanced diet and doing exercise. However, most food available is very much not healthy and being healthy takes additional effort, time and money to prepare good food. Often people don't have these available so they just eat unhealthy. You could say that healthy eating is very much opt in rather than the default option.

Healthcare is also a concern as even in countries that have free healthcare, the wealthy can pay for better healthcare. As such the general public is worse off.

## The Result

DC is pretty good overall as many countries have a free public healthcare. Healthy eating and getting exercise is more of an issue as it takes effort to choose this option and consumers are manipulated into unhealthy options.
