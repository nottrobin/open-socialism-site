title: 'Privacy'
---

DC is pretty good in terms of privacy. The government creates laws that protect privacy and companies need to follow these laws. It does have a few downsides though.

## Privacy Implications Are Buried In A Heavy Amount of Legalese

Unfortunately it is difficult at best to maintain awareness of the privacy implications of using modern technology. Often important privacy information is deliberately buried in legalese and so people don't know what they are accepting. Also reading all the privacy statements which can be updated with new releases of software is very time consuming and not terribly feasible.

## Privacy Can Be Ignored Due To 'Terrorism'

DC starts with noble intentions but the threat of 'terrorism' can cause government agencies to conduct mass surveillance which violates individuals privacy. This perhaps is not a hugely valid point since any type of society can go down this path.

## The Result

DC doesn't have any kind of terrible systemic privacy issues. However, companies do have various tricks available to go against a users likely wishes around privacy, if they understood what was happening.

Assessment: 7/10
