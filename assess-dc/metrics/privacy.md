title: 'Privacy'
---

DC is pretty good in terms of privacy. The government creates laws that protect privacy and companies need to follow these laws. It does have a few downsides though.

## Privacy Implications Are Buried In A Heavy Amount of Legalese

Unfortunately it is difficult at best to maintain awareness of the privacy implications of using modern technology. Often important privacy information is deliberately buried in legalese and so people don't know what they are accepting. Additionally, there is a constant stream of terms and conditions updates, so remaining informed of privacy implications is very challenging.

## Privacy Can Be Ignored Due To 'Terrorism'

DC starts with noble intentions but the threat of 'terrorism' can cause government agencies to conduct mass surveillance which violates individual's privacy. Perhaps this is not tied to DC as such though.

## The Result

DC doesn't have big systemic privacy issues. However, companies do have various tricks available to go against a users likely wishes around privacy, if they understood what was happening.

Assessment: 7/10
