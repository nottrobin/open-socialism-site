title: Long Term And Short Term Balance
description: Democratic capitalism demonstrably fails to value long term thinking with the level of environmental destruction and general wastage it supports.

DC is very poor in this area. Most work and is focused on increasing the income of a company, usually for the current quarter or financial year. It is rare for a company to invest in long term gains as the executives are incentivized by year bonuses and salaries.

Even when DC does use long term thinking it tends to be just for the good of one company, despite that companies working together should be more beneficial in the long run. The software industry is a notable exception to this where companies develop free tooling and make it available for everyone. It is remarkable how effective this can be and it is one of the reasons why software companies are becoming the biggest and most productive in the world.

Unfortunately even when a a company focuses on long term profit, it is still not actually good for the long term future of everyone. Profit for environmental destruction, or even simply wastage is detrimental to our collective future, but is directly incentivized in DC.

The plus side of DC is that people do have a goal of enjoying their lives and not always focusing on the long term. This is good as happy people working and enjoying themselves is important for a productive and sustainable society.

## The Result

DC fails to favor long term thinking but in some good ways does focus on short term thinking. Damaging the environment is the most unforgivable example of favoring the short term gain when humans will need to inhabit the planet for a long time yet.
