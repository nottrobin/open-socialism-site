title: 'Long Term And Short Term Balance'
---

DC is very poor in this area. Most work and development is done to maximize the share price of a company for short term profits. This is usually in disregard for making investments that pay off in more than 5 years. It is also especially with a disregard for the environment which the destruction of can be devastating in the long term.

Even when DC does use long term thinking it tends to be just for the good of one company, even when companies working together can be even more beneficial in the long run. The software industry is a notable exception to this where companies develop free tooling and make it available for everyone. It is remarkable how effective this can be and it is one of the reasons why software companies are becoming the biggest and most productive in the world.

The plus side of DC is that people do have a goal of enjoying their lives and not always focusing on the long term. This is good as happy people working and enjoying themselves is important for a productive and sustainable society.

## The Result

Generally DC fails in various ways to favor long term thinking but in some good ways does focus on short term thinking. Damaging the environment is the most unforgivable example of favoring the short term gain when humans will need to inhabit the planet for a long time yet.
