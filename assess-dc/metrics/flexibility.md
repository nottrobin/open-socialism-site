title: 'Flexibility'

DC is not very flexible. This is due to a few reasons.

## Range of flexibility

DC's range of flexibility is quite varied between societies.

### To what degree can the wealthy influence political decisions

To what degree can wealthy and corrupt (in the sense that they do not value the good of the many) people and influence politics.

An example of the inflexibility of DC is taxation on the wealthy and wealth inequality. [For example the top 1% in the US own 40% of the wealth and the bottom 80% own 7% of the wealth](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/opinion/nicholas-kristof-idiots-guide-to-inequality-piketty-capital.html). This inequality is possible largely through low taxes on the rich and tax loopholes. It is clearly in the interest of the many to raise taxes on the rich and close these loopholes but DC system in the US is not flexible enough to do it. That is because the politicians need political donations from the wealthy and so they wont introduce policy that they may not like.

Other DC countries have more taxation on the rich and regulation of corporations which limits the political influence of the wealthy. However the same fundamental issue exists in that the wealthy do have political power and thus the range of changes that can be made, even if they are for the greater good, is limited.

The actual influence itself is done via 3 main processes

#### Political donations

To be elected politicians need money for an electoral campaign. For example [Obama's campaign of 2012 cost 1.1 billion](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/230318-the-5-billion-campaign){:target="_blank"}. These donations have strings attached which allows those that make them to influence political decisions.

#### Political lobbying

Lobbying can involve political donations but also involves treating politicians to various dinners and events. It also involves presenting information to politicians in easily digestible formats as they can sometimes struggle to understand all the issues they have to vote on due to the complexity and variety of related areas. However, the lobbyists will present the information in such a way as to make the outcome they prefer seem like the obvious choice.

#### Influence of the public

Wealthy individuals and corporations can manipulate the public to support certain viewpoints. If the public hold a certain viewpoint it is unlikely that politicians will deviate from that viewpoint.

For example the [Global Energy Balance Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Energy_Balance_Network){:target="_blank"} was a US-based non-profit investigating causes of obesity which found that exercise was the key, not diet. This group received substantial funding from Coca Cola.

### To what degree is the political system motivated by self interest

Other limitations on flexibility is political parties and individual politicians are by in large interested in staying in power first and assisting the greater good second. This creates a lot of oppositional politics.

For example in Australia there was a proposal to replace it's aging telecommunications infrastructure with an optic fiber network by the Labor Party. The existing copper network was poor and expensive as it had a high ongoing maintenance cost. As Labor ran with the idea to election the other major party, the Liberal Party (and the National Party as a coalition) needed to oppose it despite the fact that it was clearly a good idea and all of industry that didn't have some vested interest was in favor. The Liberals have since come into power and are reverting back to a plan that will utilize the copper network and is highly inefficient in the long term. For political reasons, not for the greater good, they had to take this stance.

This kind of putting the greater good second can also be seen at an individual politician level where the goal is typically to get elected first and have policies that contribute the most to the greater good second.

### To what degree do the public themselves want what is best for all

The public are not experts and generally are short sighted. Increased taxation on everyone may be necessary to avoid a financial crisis but it is likely the party promoting this will not be voted in. Those in power do not have the flexibility to do what is right but is not palatable to the public.

## Change is a slow process

DC societies can take a long time to draft changes such as a new law. There are various stages of deliberation and typically it must pass through multiple 'houses' of parliament.

This deliberation is supposed to refine the change so it isn't a bad thing per se. Changes can also be rushed through if necessary.

The major issue with speed is when the change is not accepted by the majority of politicians. It can take a lot of time for sufficient political pressure to grow before the politicians capitulate.

Generally DC is pretty good with this.

## Experimentation

DC is quite poor in regards to experimentation. Rather it tends to have a longer deliberation process to get it right the first time. When it is so hard and time consuming to make a change, it isn't that feasible to experiment and refine even though this typically results in a more long term improvement.

## Overall

Assessment: 3/10

DC is ultimately quite inflexible as there are various segments of society corrupting the decision making process in various ways.
