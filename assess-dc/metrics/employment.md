title: Employment
description: Democratic capitalism is pretty good at creating jobs, but globalization can causes issues within certain countries.

DC itself is actually pretty good with providing employment to people. Unemployment rates typically sit at around 5%.

The issue with employment more so comes from globalization and the fact that menial work can be done in poor countries for a much lower wage. Since corporations care about profits above providing jobs to people locally wealthy DC countries have a decreasing local workforce. The internet is also adding to this effect as collaboration with workers in different countries increasingly becomes easier.

## The Result

There aren't many barriers to employment under DC but globalization can cause problems when a DC society sits in a global economy.
