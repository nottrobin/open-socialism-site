title: 'Crime'
---

DC does a reasonable job of dealing with crime. The main issue is that with wealth inequality the poorest people can struggle to raise children in happy homes which makes these children more prone to crime. The poor can also have trouble succeeding with legal work as they are disadvantaged in terms of their education.

The African American poor communities in the US is a good example of these issues that DC can have.

At the same time, it is hard to tie these problems too much with DC as countries like Australia have quite a low crime rate.

## The Result

There are factors that can push people towards crime in DC, but socialistic versions of DC do not particularly have an issues with this.
