## tl;dr of the tl;dr

Democratic capitalism (DC) had some good years and achieved a lot, but it has started to be highly inequitable and exploitative. With modern technology, science and advances in project and team management, there is a huge range of techniques that can be employed to create much better systems. We can create a cooperative system that is much more equitable and productive than DC.

## Democratic capitalism not so good

Note, DC (primarily capitalism) is the dominant system in control of our global society so it is valid to look at it at a global level.

* DC is performing really poorly in terms of being equitable. [The wealthiest 1% in the world have more wealth than the bottom 99%. The wealthiest 8 people have as much wealth as the bottom 3.6 billion](https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2017-01-16/just-8-men-own-same-wealth-half-world){:target="_blank"}.
* Numbers like this are startling but still hard to appreciate. [Check out this graph for family wealth in the US](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51846){:target="_blank"} (significantly less inequality than at a global level though).
* DC is damaging the environment. Worst example, [Elon Musk sums up the global warming issue really well and talks about how 97% of scientists believe the transition to sustainable energy will be catastrophic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKCuDxpccYM){:target="_blank"}. Another example, [We are expending the resouces of 1.6 planets per year](http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/world_footprint/){:target="_blank"}.

## We should be able to design a better system

* DC as a system is 300 years old. Surely a modern rethink is possible.
* Humanity has acheived incredible technology. Entirely new ways of organizing is now possible.
* Humans themselves are now much more deeply understood through constant scientific studies.
* Modern business, in particular technology companies, have continually advanced how they as small societies operate (noteably, [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development){:target="_blank"}). This has resulted in many techniques that are very applicable to how society can operate.
* [Open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software){:target="_blank"} has also advanced techniques to manage teams and culture. The [open source model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model){:target="_blank"} has a lot relevance to managing a society.

## What is a good new system then?

* Look at a company like Google. It has no bias to any particular system. Are positions within the company decided by democratic voting? Is everyone given a share of the companies resources and they compete against each other to make money for the company?
* No, primarily people are all working together towards common goals. There are elements of competition and voting in certain areas, but these are tools applied only when and where it makes sense, not as the underlying system.
* This is because the most efficient way for humans to be productive is to cooperate, which isn't suprising given we evolved to operate cooperatively in a tribe. [More info on the inefficiency of the free market](/open-socialism/arguments/the-free-market-is-inefficient).
* The main argument against cooperative systems at a societal level is it won't work because people will become corrupt. However, this is a solvable problem.
* Much like open source, all information both in real time and historical can be made available on the internet, meaning corruption needs to happen under the nose of the entirety of society.
* The [consensus seeking model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making) of decision making can be used to make corrupting a decision requiring corrupting the majority of a committee, which is much more difficult than corrupting an individual leader.
* Of course, humans still need to be incentivized to strive, so very moderate inequality should be allowed for those who do great work towards the greater good.
