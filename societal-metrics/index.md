title: Societal Metrics
description: To be able to compare societal systems, a set of metrics are required.
---

The goal is to create a set of metrics that can be used to assess a societal system.

As much as possible the metrics should be measurable. Each metric should also have a weighting of how important it is. For example the survival of the populous is more important than it's happiness.
