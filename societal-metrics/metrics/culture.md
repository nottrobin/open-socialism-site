What is the level of cultural expression? How much art, music and other forms of cultural expression are being produced or pursued and what is the diversity of these?
Assuming the productivity of society is not being greatly sacrificed the more cultural expression the better.

Are there rituals that bring people together and reinforce relationships (eg. Christmas celebration)?
