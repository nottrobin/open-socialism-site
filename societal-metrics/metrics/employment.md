Probably the best thing is to measure the number of [NEET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET) people. People who are physically and mentally able, not otherwise occupied (eg. raising a family), and for no apparent reason choose not to work or study.

People generally like and need to be productive in some fashion and it's good for society as well so this is a good metric.

This can also go too far as well with the young or elderly being forced to work.
