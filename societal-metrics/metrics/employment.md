Probably the best thing is to measure the number of [NEET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET) people who are essentially doing nothing for society with their time (raising children would certainly not be in this category) and are physically and mentally able.

People generally like and need to be productive in some fashion and it's good for society as well so this is a good metric.

This can also go too far as well with young or elderly people being forced to work.
