This can be subjective as to what is considered an invasion of privacy. However, generally how often and to what degree is personal information (against an individuals wishes) made available, deliberately or accidentally, to other people.

Complete privacy is not necessary the goal as privacy should be sacrificed sometimes for the good of the people.
