To what degree is the society ensuring the people's survival. Note: the society should not be purely focused on ensuring the societies survival in it's current form because adaption and restructure can be beneficial.

Questions can be:

* Is long term survival being harmed by any present day actions? eg. environmental damage
* Are there long term plans for human survival? eg. how to transition from fossil fuels
