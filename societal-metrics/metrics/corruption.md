## Systemic Corruption

How much does the system reward valuing oneself/one's group over the greater good? There is a blurry line as to what constitutes systemic corruption. Probably the best line to draw is that the action, whilst legal, is exploitative in nature (one group benefits and others suffer).

## Non-Systemic Corruption

How easy is it to influence a decision through illegal bribery at different levels of society?
