Wealth equality is a complex issue. It cannot be necessarily said that 100% equality is ideal as that could be considered not rewarding individual effort. A certain level of wealth inequality is arguably a good thing.

Though, it is pretty clear that excessive wealth inequality is not good for society. At the very least if wealth inequality is leading to poverty, even for those not working it can be considered detrimental.
