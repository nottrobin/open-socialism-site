title: 'Rights Equality'
---

Rights equality is about making the same options available to everyone. This needs to be the rights that are effectively available, not what the letter of the law says. For example all people may have the same legal rights, but if expensive lawyers give a rich person an advantage then this is not actually equal rights. Assessing rights equality needs to be about the reality of what options are available to people regardless of wealth, class or any other difference.

Without rights equality it is a class system and the populace will tend to become discontent.
