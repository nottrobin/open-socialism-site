title: The Media
description: Open socialism would have limited need for specific media organisations.

There would be some news organization responsible for breaking down and communicating the news.

However, there is much less need for the media in the form it is in a DC society. In DC, with segments of self interest, there is a lot of incentive to conceal or misrepresent facts.

In OS all areas of society are firstly completely transparent already and also have minimal incentive to conceal or misrepresent. For example a fault being concealed to ensure sales of a certain product is a common story in a DC society, however in OS there is no incentive to sell a product with a fault since there is no profit being made in the first place.

Individuals may wish to conceal their own mistakes but that is a problem of individual circles/projects to solve. Self reporting is also a function of a circle/project so the media is not so important.
