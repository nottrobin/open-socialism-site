How would a comedian for example work?

Similar to DC it would be based on supply and demand. There is certain amount of demand for comedians. The challenge is to allow the best comedians to rise to the top (by using some kind of rating system) and fill that need by allowing the public to see them. Someone consistently rated as unfunny probably can't be a comedian.
