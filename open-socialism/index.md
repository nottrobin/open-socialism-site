Open Socialism (OS) is a societal system that is designed to be the highly equitable, productive and favor long term thinking. It combines ideas from socialism, communism, capitalism, democracy, [the open source software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_movement){:target="_blank"}), [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development){:target="_blank"} and [evolutionary psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology){:target="_blank"}.

## Socialism

OS starts with the concept of a state owned socialist system. A directed and cooperative society is on paper much more efficient at providing value to the greatest number of people, when compared with a capitalist society. This is because [resources are expended in competition and aligning companies goals to the good of people is difficult](arguments/the-free-market-is-inefficient).

OS greatly differs here from capitalism. It takes an optimistic base concept that should be more effective and attempts to mitigate the issues, rather than basing the whole system on something non-optimal. This is how OS can, in theory, be a great improvement over democratic capitalism.

## Openness

State owned socialism has inherent risks as a societal system. Those at the top can have control to a far greater degree than is possible under capitalism, where a lot of the power rests with companies and individuals.

Humans are [inherently corrupt and will seek advantage for themselves](arguments/normal-human-corruption), dealing with corruption is the most important issue for any society to deal with.

OS deals with this in a few ways. Primarily, like the [open source model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model){:target="_blank"}, almost all information around decision making, deliberation and work is publicly available, both in real time and historical. This includes mechanisms to allow the public to flag questionable decisions (and also generally contribute if they please). As such, corruption needs to happen under the nose of the entirety of society. The higher up in society a decision is being made, the more scrutiny that can be expected.

## Structure

In OS the means of production are state owned and there is no free enterprise. How does OS manage with everyone working for the one giant organization?
