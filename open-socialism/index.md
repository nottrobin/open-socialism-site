description: A high level overview of the open socialism system.

Open Socialism (OS) is a societal system that is designed to be the highly equitable, productive and favor long term thinking. It combines ideas from socialism, communism, capitalism, democracy, [the open source software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_movement){:target="_blank"}), [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development){:target="_blank"} and [evolutionary psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology){:target="_blank"}.

## Socialism

OS starts with the concept of a state owned socialist system. A directed and cooperative society is on paper much more efficient at providing value to the greatest number of people, when compared with a capitalist society. This is because under capitalism [resources are expended in competition and aligning companies goals to the good of people is difficult](arguments/the-free-market-is-inefficient).

OS greatly differs here from capitalism. It takes an optimistic base concept that should be more effective and attempts to mitigate the issues, rather than basing the whole system on something non-optimal. This is how OS can, in theory, be a great improvement over democratic capitalism.

## Reward Individual Effort

Humans are [inherently self serving and will seek advantage for themselves](arguments/normal-human-corruption). It is inhuman to expect people to follow ideals like ["from each according to their ability, to each according to their need"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs){:target="_blank"}.

If individuals cannot strive for personal success within the system, they will be forced to attempt to circumvent it. Thus OS recognizes humans inherent self-serving nature and rewards people rising up in society and doing great work. However, unlike capitalism the difference between the top and bottom of society need not be excessive. 5 times the salary may be sufficient incentive, but this is a knob to be tuned. [Humans do not need extreme rewards to be driven to strive!](arguments/people-will-be-incentivized-to-work).

## Corruption

State owned socialism has inherent risks as a societal system. Those at the top can have control to a far greater degree than is possible under capitalism where a lot of the power rests with companies and individuals. Incentivizing rising up the ranks with increased remuneration also is likely stimulate corruption and nepotism.

### Openness

OS deals with this in a few ways. Primarily, like the [open source model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model){:target="_blank"}, almost all information around the work of society is publicly available, both in real time and historical. This includes mechanisms to allow the public to flag questionable decisions (and also generally contribute if they please). As such, corruption needs to happen under the nose of the entirety of society. The higher up in society a decision is being made, the more scrutiny that can be expected.

### Consensus Based Decision Making

OS favors consensus based decision making. Decisions made by a group of people are far less likely to be corrupt. This is because changing the decision requires corrupting multiple decision makers as opposed to just corrupting a single individual leader.

Consensus based decision making can be slow with consensus difficult to reach. OS uses the [consensus seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making){:target="_blank"} variant which aims for consensus but falls back to voting if consensus cannot be reached.

## Structure

In OS the means of production are state owned and there is no free enterprise. How does OS manage with everyone working for the one giant organization?

### Flexibility

### Continual Improvement
