title: 'Open Socialism'

Open Socialism (OS) is a societal system that is designed to be the highly equitable, productive and favor long term thinking. It combines ideas from socialism, communism, capitalism, democracy, [the open source software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_movement){:target="_blank"}), [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development){:target="_blank"} and [evolutionary psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology){:target="_blank"}.

The core logic for OS is as follows.

## Start with Communism

Communism (in the sense that the people collectively own and run the means of production) is on paper much more efficient than Capitalism.

Capitalism has wastage due to:

* duplication of effort (all companies need to run a HR department)
* duplication of research
* advertising
* legal defense and offense
* regulation (still required in Communism but self regulation is more efficient than the law creation, auditing, policing process)
* taxation efforts
* shareholder reporting
* [rent seeking behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking) which decreases overall wealth

Consolidating the production of goods and services into the one organization is much more efficient.

## Hmm but Communism has always failed

Communism has always failed because, like Democratic Capitalism (DC), it has never been created in such a way that specifically deals with normal human corruption that leads to a class system (or it has been fascism/dictatorism wearing the mask of Communism to seize power).

The problem is it can never be assumed that humans won't be corrupt in any system. Humans instinctively try to gain advantage for themselves which improves their chances of passing on their genes and their offspring in turn passing on their genes. Corruption is not humans being 'bad', it is humans being humans!

The tribal system dealt with this perfectly in that humans were living close to the brink so they had to work together. Helping one's tribe was helping oneself since the individual is entirely dependent on the tribe for survival. Being corrupt and hoarding food for example would result in an individual being ostracized so corruption was limited. As such self interested behavior was the kind that would also help the tribe as whole.

This problem of having self interested behaviour also help the group is a core issue that any system including Communism needs to solve. It is more important in Communism because if everyone works for the state those who run the state have an incredible amount of power. They have the power to rule over the entirety of society and them working for their own self interest and hurting the greater good is much more destructive.

## Ok ok, so we should as a first step try and align self interest with the good of society

Humans want to be selfish and get ahead. They want to be prestigious and to have more wealth than others. Ok no problem!

Society will have different levels of leaders and those that get ahead should get more money and prestige. However, the difference in wealth between someone at the top of society should not be hugely different than a member at the bottom of society. It might be something like 5x as much, although this is a knob to be tuned. More evenly distributed wealth will mean (particularly when modern technology is factored in) that the 'lowest' members of society will have an abundance and so should be satisfied.

With everyone striving for and being rewarded for providing value to society itself and not a private company this means self interest is very nicely aligned with the good of society.

## Sounds good, but what about corruption?

Yes, corruption should still be expected.

Ok, let's make virtually all information and decision making completely open and available on the internet, from all levels of society, both in real time and historically. This means that any corruption needs to be done under the nose of the entirety of society. We should also have feedback mechanisms where anyone can flag a decision as corrupt (or simply bad) and this feedback will feed back into decision makers.

Hmm I like. Let's also have important decisions made using the [consensus seeking model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making){:target="_blank"}. So there is a committee and they try and achieve consensus to make a decision. This promotes discussion to achieve a good result. However, if consensus cannot be achieved a 2/3 majority vote is required to make a decision. If repeatedly a 2/3 majority cannot be a reached a final vote can be had that only requires a 50% majority. The voting system means that the committee will not be bogged down forever trying to reach a consensus.

The great thing about this system is that to corrupt a decision it is necessary to corrupt over 50% of a committee which is obviously far more difficult than corrupting a single leader.

## Conclusion

It should be possible to start with a idealistic cooperative and highly productive base and use human intellect and technology to deal with the classic societal problems of corruption and providing motivation to individuals to work towards the greater good.

Starting with an pessimistic system such as DC is not necessary and it has shown itself to be highly inequitable and inefficient. At the very least starting with an idealistic base as per OS it is possible to outperform DC in terms of societal metrics

There is a lot more to OS than this, but these are the core concepts of a highly cooperative society that has minimal corruption, whilst also rewarding individuals.
