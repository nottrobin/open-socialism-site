title: 'What Motivates People?'

There are three levels to the motivations of people.

## The evovled individual biological urge

All our ancestors have done something. They have reproduced and raised their offspring in an environment which allowed them to in turn reproduce.

The desire to reproduce and propagate ones own DNA is the primary biological urge. However, reproducing with a person or in an environment which isn't going to be beneficial for the offspring's chances of thriving and they themselves reproducing doesn't constitute 'successfully reproducing'.

In other words, it isn't enough to reproduce.

* You need to reproduce with someone else with desirable DNA.
* You need to belong to a tribe or community that can support your offspring.

This is why purely looking at humans as self serving is faulty. Humans have evovled to depend on a community to survive, especially when raising children which are a burden on that community while they are young.

Reproducing and community are both essential ingredients for successful reproduction (in an evolutionary sense) for humans as such they are equally motivated for both these goals.

## The evolved group biological urge

All our ancestors have also predominantly belonged to groups that have survived.

Groups with individuals which can fight and sacrifice themselves even without passing on their DNA are stronger than groups with members that cannot sacrifice their chance to reproduce.

As such we have a strong urge to protect our community which can be stronger than our urge to pass on our own DNA.

## The cultural urges

Homo Sapiens were the ultimate winners within the Human genus in that they eventually wiped out other human species such as the neanderthals.

[Sapiens: A Brief History Of Humankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind){:target="_blank"} suggests that this was enabled by Homo Sapiens ability to invent myth and culture. This in turn enabled numbers greater than that of a neanderthal tribe to work together. Without common myths neanderthals could not cooperate in numbers of greater than around 100 people which Homo Sapiens could.

A modern day example of a myth would be a nation which is a concept in the minds of the people that live in that nation that allow them to work together and trust strangers.

For monkeys and neanderthals it is sufficient to purely look at the evovled biological individual and group urges. These urges are still paramount to human motivation in the modern world, but it is important to note that we have developed cultural motivations which are entirely separate from them. For example, an individual wanting to become a celebrate priest despite that this means they won't reproduce.
