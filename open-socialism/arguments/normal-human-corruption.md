title: 'Normal Human Corruption'
---

Given the [motivations of people](what-motivates-people) how do humans operate?

Put simply, humans look after their community whilst acting as selflishly as possible, insofar as it doesn't affect their place in that community, or threaten the community itself. This selfishness can be considered 'normal human corruption' and is natural behavior for humans.

## In the tribal system

In a traditional tribe the community is obviously the tribe. Primarily humans work towards assisting the tribe. This looks after the tribe and ensures the individuals place in that tribe, both of which are necessary for the individuals survival.

The selfish behaviour which is possible is promotion of oneself over ones peers for mates and power within the tribe. These are possible only through some form of excellence. All this selfish striving is also good for the tribe as everyone has to become stronger (in some way) to compete.

## In capitalism

In captialism what people consider their communities is varied. In most cases it is the extended family plus a social group of friends in a similar class. The big difference is that the work to support that community (earning money) is totally unrelated and hidden from their personal community.

An individual can be unscrupulous at work, harming others for ones own profit, which is net negative for their wider community (state, country, industry, demographic, etc.). However, this is seperate from their personal community so such 'bad' behaviour has no negative impact to them. In fact it is the opposite, increasing ones power (wealth) though such acts allows them to earn more money and have greater prestige in their personal community.

## Conclusion

Humans will naturally seek advantage for themselves whilst looking after their communities.

However, what an individual considers their community and the scope of selfish behaviour available has a tremendous impact on a society.

Highly wealthy and 'unscrupulous' indviduals are not 'bad' people, they are just operating within a system that rewards such behaviour.
