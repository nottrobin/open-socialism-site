Law will still exist. There will be two major differences however.

* A large amount of law will no longer be required. Law relating to patents and business will not be necessary any more. Law will largely be about ethical conduct to your fellow humans.
* Law will not be absolute. The letter of the law will no longer be the final decider in any particular issue. Rather (likely a group of) people will, with the guidance of the law, be empowered to use their own moral judgment and make a decision. The reason for this is the letter of the law can never keep up with an evolving society and there will always be exceptions and loopholes. Giving people the power to make their best judgment beyond the specific wording of the law should result in more fair judgments. Having more fair judgments is more valuable than being able to clearly justify any one decision (which we still only have to a certain degree).
