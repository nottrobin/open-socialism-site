description: How would open socialism regulate drug usage.

All drugs will be legal within OS. Prohibition creates more problems than it solves. Society would also manufacture drugs that people want to use unless they are extremely damaging (it's always preferable to make the drugs safely rather than have people resort to dangerous illicit manufacture).

However:

* Extensive research will be performed on currently illicit drugs to give very clear indication of their dangers and methods of safer usage. Currently this is avoided largely because illegal drugs are supposed to have no safe methods of usage which is not true, at least for all illicit drugs.
* Superb rehab + education would be set up around drugs to help people avoid drug abuse/dependence.
