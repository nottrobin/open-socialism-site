description: How does open socialism manage religion.

Not much to say on religion other than it can continue to exist under Open Socialism. However, it would have no place in the work place or in education.

Beyond current religions it should also be considered what rituals or processes can be used to help people who are atheists be spiritually satisfied. [Alain de Botton writes about religin for atheists](https://www.alaindebotton.com/religion/){:target="_blank"}.
