title: Reward Individual Effort
description: Open socialism has a tenet of rewarding individuals for great work.

Traditional systems that had no free enterprise did not sufficiently reward individual effort. Humans are collaborative, but are also fundamentally self-interested. An inability to advance in society and reap rewards stifles individual effort.
An advancement of position should confer an increase in remuneration, in some sense, to the individual. This could be an increase in salary or prestige but the specifics are open to debate. However, the severe wealth discrepancy seen in Capitalism should not be possible regardless of the position achieved.
