title: Start With Ideal Solutions
description: Open socialism has a tenet starting with ideal solutions, then mitigating possible issues.

Often when solving a problem there is an ideal solution and a pessimistic solution. It is usually better to start with the ideal solution as a base and then augment it to deal with any problems.

For example, there is the problem of murderers. A pessimistic solution is to lock them up forever or execute them. An ideal solution is to lock them up but try and rehabilitate them so once their penance is complete they can again be productive members of society. Rehabilitating and releasing them comes with its own set of problems but the ideal solution should be attempted rather than just go with an easy option.
