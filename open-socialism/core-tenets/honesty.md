Individuals and groups should strive towards being honest. In particular they should be honest when this makes them vulnerable and open to criticism.

The goal is to set up systems that promote and reward honesty, especially when this honesty pertains to some negative result. This is as opposed to expecting people to be honest all the time regardless of whether this benefits them or not.
