title: Rights Equality
description: Open socialism has a tenet of equal rights to all.

All people regardless of any particular attributes such as race, gender or sexual preference, should have equal rights and opportunities. This includes any distinction based on income or prestige in society.

This does not imply equality of income or more broadly reward. However, that income can only provide non-essential benefits. Essentials such as health and education are considered a human right. This includes any kind of tiered system where more money can buy better education.
