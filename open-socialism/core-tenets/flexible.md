description: Open socialism has a tenet of being flexible to be able to operate in an ever changing and diverse world.

In modern democracy fairness is achieved by having very specific processes and laws such as the party system and elections. However, these processes are very rigid and difficult to change if they are not serving the greater good.

The ideal to aim for is an adaptive system that can:

* make individual decisions based on what is 'good' or 'right' without it necessarily being tied to the letter of the law or policy.
* easily change and iterate upon processes when they no longer fit with what is required.
* have different parts of the system run in completely different ways.
* aim for long term improvement. Greater flexibility (but more short term mistakes) should result in more learning and in the long run less mistakes.
