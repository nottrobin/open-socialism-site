title: 'No Free Enterprise'
---

[Free enterprise has many inefficiencies that make it on paper much less efficient](/open-socialism/arguments/the-free-market-is-inefficient).

Free enterprise also tends towards wealth and power concentration that ultimately undermines governmental control.

Open Socialism is focused on leveraging the benefits of no free enterprise whilst handling the classic problems this can cause.

It's also worth noting the 'no free enterprise' is still a knob and it's possible that zero is not the right setting. This needs to be assessed further, particularly with experiments, once an OS society is running.
