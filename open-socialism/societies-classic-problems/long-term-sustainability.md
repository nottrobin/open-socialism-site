title: Long Term Sustainability
description: A lack of focus on the long term, in particular the long term sustainablity of society is a classical problem.

This is a classical issue as humans tend to take short term profits for long term loss as long as they are not the ones facing the loss. For example the destruction of the environment. In economics speak this is referred to as an [externality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality){:target="_blank"}. However, we cannot exist in an environment unless we find sustainable means to support ourselves.
