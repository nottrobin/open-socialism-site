title: Efficiency
description: Societies have a classical problem of work only contributing to the greater good in a limited way. This can be thought of as an efficiency problem.

To what degree does people acting in self interest lead to the betterment of society. This should never be 100% as that may be sacrificing individual desires for society too much.

Efficiency tends to suffer due to

* wastage due to competition
* [rent seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking) behavior
* wealth being used wastefully and selfishly by the powerful

Poor efficiency is a classical problem.
