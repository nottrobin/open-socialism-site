description: How does open socialism determine the pricing of goods.

The pricing of goods and services is tricky. The ultimate goal is to balance the amount of effort spent on the greater long term good vs the enjoyment of the day to day.

If for example yachts were sold for $1 everyone would buy one and society would have to spend all its time making yachts. The goal is to allow people to enjoy a variety of services and purchase a moderate amount of goods for their own enjoyment and at the same time continue to heavily invest in longer term investments for the good of all society.

There is no simple answer to this and exactly how the prices can be derived would need to be determined.
