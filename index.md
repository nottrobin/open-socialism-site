  <h1>Open Socialism</h1>
  <small>a compelling alternative to democratic capitalism</small>
</header>

Open Socialism (OS) is a rethink on how to run a society. It takes the best parts from communism, socialism, capitalism, democracy and a variety of other sources and offers a new and radically different system than the currently popular democratic capitalism.

## Foundational Ideas

OS is based on two core ideas.

1. A cooperative system is more effective at working towards the greater good than a competitive system.

2. Classical cooperative systems like Communism have failed due to corruption, <em>but this is a solvable problem with modern technology</em>.

If we accept these as true we can cherry pick the best of modern cooperative systems, especially those that utilise cutting edge technology.
