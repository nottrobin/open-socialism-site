So you want to help? Awesome!

To learn about the system have a look at the [introduction](/introduction). Then checkout [Open Socialism in more detail](/open-socialism) and the [core tenets](/open-socialism/core-tenets), then read about [circles](/open-socialism/hierarchy/circles).

Also check out the [plan](/plan) to understand the current and next milestone for OS.

## Why help in the first place?

We can't all change the world for the better in our day jobs. This project is about improving the world and is founded on the belief that we as humanity can do much better. It feels good (hopefully) working towards a better future.

It should also use cool technology. If you are work in IT this can be a place to practice with things like [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine){:target="_blank"}, using fancy and overkill solutions but learning along the way :)

## What help is currently desired?

Any help in any capacity is welcome ranging from redesigning the entire system to fixing typos. If you want you can even join and regularly contribute if it's something you care about.

Generally at this stage the most important help that is required is criticizing the system, pointing out flaws, showing evidence that OS (or parts of it) wont work and identifying missing information in OS.

Maybe OS is fundamentally broken. If you can show this it is the most valuable help because it will provide the most fuel for OS to improve.

## I want to help, is there any recommended reading?

If you want to help but feel like you need more knowledge of human history and societies the following books are good.

* [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095){:target="_blank"}. A history of Homo Sapiens and societies.
* [Utopia for Realists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_for_Realists_(book)){:target="_blank"}. Gives a good summary of the current state of affairs with DC (and suggests some good steps DC can move towards).

## I want to help, what skills do I need?

A very basic understanding of [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) which is easy to learn.

If you want to work on the site code, some knowledge of [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} and web technologies is required.
